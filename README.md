### 📌 **Project Overview**

This project showcases a complete analytics workflow, including:

1. **Data Extraction**

   * Automated dataset download using the Kaggle API.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

   * Utilized Python and Pandas to handle missing values, transform data types, and remove inconsistencies.

3. **Database Integration**

   * Loaded the cleaned dataset into an SQL Server database for scalable querying.

4. **Data Analysis**

   * Performed analytical SQL queries to uncover trends and patterns in the data.
